Library App

###SPEC

1. Restrict access to the library to admin users

2. Show all books available in a library along with availability.

3. Track books that have been given to people visiting the library.
   Like for example, if there are 10 copies of `The Jungle Book` and 6 books have been taken by 6 different people,
   it should say that 4 copies are available.
